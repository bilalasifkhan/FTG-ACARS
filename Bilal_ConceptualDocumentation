Elements we need our engine to measure:

1) Altitude
2) Speed
3) Fuel on Board (FOB)
4) GMT TIME (Present state)
5) Block Times 

These Elements can be measured seperately in individual classes.
Therefore our DataRecord Class Definitons should be:

Pilot (Main parent)

Children: Elements as mentioned above.

Each child class must be extended from one parent class in order to keep things simple.
Each pilot and child elements will record minimum number of variables and each variable set must be private. Therefore, each class will have helper methods to protect variables.

This is a very basic setup of how we can store our records and retrieve them.

Again:
The main Pilot Class I suggest could be called PilotAcars, its dependent children would be ElementAcars eg. AltitudeAcars, SpeedAcars, BlockTimesAcars, etc.
BlockTimesAcars could save time as long ?? <- This is a suggestion...

Again this is the basic setup I was thinking on how to keep track of ACARS records ...
