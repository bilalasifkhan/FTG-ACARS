Hi
My name is Bilal Asif Khan.
My FTG Pilot ID is EK241, and I am glad to be part of the team :).

This is part of me trying to get used to applying UNIX commands in this GitHub environment. Pretty neat tool.
Once figured out, I will upload some ideas for the application.
Hope it turns out to be useful.

Thanks.
